Storage Providers maintain significant hardware requirements, which typically include high bandwidth connections to the internet.<br><br>Aside from distribution, all content on the network is cryptographically hashed into a unique value called a CID, or content identifier. This means that if any data changes at all, the CID changes. For content within datasets, this adds a unique feature: immutability. Information contained in a dataset becomes tamper proof, because if anything changes, it's immediately evident from the CID being different. This is especially useful when considering the problem of safeguarding data from manipulation by biased parties.<br><br>One of Filecoin's core missions is to store humanity's most important information, and the Open Panda project is directly aligned with that mission.  At this point in time, downloading and working with the data on the platform still requires an understanding of how Filecoin works and some use of specialized software, but over time we plan to abstract those hurdles away, in the interest of a smoother and more user-friendly experience and a minimal learning curve."

            "description": "Open Panda is a platform that makes open datasets that are stored on the Filecoin network accessible and available for download. Filecoin is able to support the storage of massive collections of data, but it's not obvious what data is available on the network or where it can be found. The Open Panda interface will help you discover the datasets on the network, where they're stored, and how to retrieve them."

            "description": "Open data is stored on a distributed network is inherently safer than the same data stored in a centralized place. A centralized location exposes the data to potential threats such as a concentration risk from a lack of redundancy, or tampering. Open Panda aims to provide 5 or more copies of each dataset stored on the network at a given time, giving users more download options while effectively eliminating these threats."

            "description": "Currently, we're working on storing a set of large public datasets that are well known and well documented. However, if you have a dataset in mind that the community might benefit from, you can submit a new dataset for review by opening a Github issue in this repository. In the future, we'll allow direct submission of dataset suggestions via Open Panda."

            "description": "Data is stored with Storage Providers in thousands of different locations around the world. When browsing a dataset or CID, you'll notice flags appear signifying a country or region. Each flag represents the location of a Storage Provider. Storage Providers are also signified by IDs that begin with f0... which you'll come across when browsing the CIDs in a specific dataset."

            "title": "What is a CID?",
            "description": "A CID is a Content IDentifier, which uses a unique hash to represent a file or collection of data. If the contents of a file changes, the CID changes completely. This is one of the mechanisms that ensures that the data stored is never modified without everyone on the network knowing. On Open Panda's larger datasets, data is often split across many CIDs, because a CID has a maximum size of 32 GiB. For this reason, you'll come across long lists of many CIDs when browsing particularly large datasets."
