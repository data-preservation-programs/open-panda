Secondly, at this time, downloading data found on Open Panda requires specialized command line tooling, and we’re working towards making this directly accessible from the platform.We’re operating in a rapid iteration cycle, so you’re likely to see new improvements before your next visit. To help in tracking progress in a transparent way, a public roadmap and changelog will be available on this page soon.<br><br>The Open Panda team is committed to ensuring that the platform evolves into a robust and reliable tool that can meet the needs of its users. We’re actively seeking feedback from early users of the platform to help guide future development. Please reach out to us with any suggestions and comments to <a href='mailto:support@openpanda.io'>support@openpanda.io</a>. We appreciate your patience and support as we work to make Open Panda into a robust data discoverability layer for open data stored on the Filecoin network."
